Grade boundaries - June 2011 exams
Project – Levels 1 and 2
For the Level 1 and 2 Projects, the scaled mark grade boundaries are shown. As each project consists of one component, the scaled mark
grade boundaries are the same as the raw mark grade boundaries as no scaling of marks is necessary.
Uniform mark grade boundaries can be found in Appendix A of the Uniform Marks Leaflet
