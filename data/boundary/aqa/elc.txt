Grade boundaries - June 2011 exams
ELC
For ELC, the scaled mark grade boundaries are shown. As each subject consists of just one component, the scaled mark grade boundaries
are the same as the raw mark grade boundaries as no scaling of marks is necessary.
Uniform mark grade boundaries can be found in Appendix A of the Uniform Marks Leaflet
For further information, contact CERP@aqa.org.uk.
