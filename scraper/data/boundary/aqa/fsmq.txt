Scaled mark grade boundaries - June 2011 exams
FSMQ
Here you can see the scaled mark unit grade boundaries for FSMQ.
All FSMQ units consist of two components and their marks need to be scaled before they are aggregated to the overall unit-level. Only the
grade A and E scaled boundary marks are shown for each component as only these are set by the awarding committee. These scaled
marks are then added to obtain unit-level grade A and E boundaries, at which point the intermediate grade B, C and D boundary marks are
calculated for the unit as a whole. In all instances the unit is listed first, followed by its components (shaded and italicised).
Uniform mark grade boundaries can be found in Appendix A of the Uniform Marks Leaflet
For further information, contact CERP@aqa.org.uk.
