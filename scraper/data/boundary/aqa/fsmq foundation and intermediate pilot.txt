Scaled mark grade boundaries - June 2011 exams
FSMQ Foundation and Intermediate (pilot)
Here you can see the scaled mark unit grade boundaries for FSMQ Foundation and Intermediate (pilot).
Units comprising two components (units 9981, 9982 and 9983)
Where a unit consists of two components, their marks sometimes need to be scaled before they are aggregated to the overall unit-level. In
these instances only the grade A and E scaled boundary marks are shown for each component as only these are set by the awarding
committee. These scaled marks are then added to obtain unit-level grade A and E boundaries, at which point the intermediate grade B, C
and D boundary marks are calculated for the unit as a whole. Where both unit and component grade boundary marks are reported, the unit
is listed first, followed by its components (shaded and italicised).
All other units consist of just one component so the scaled mark grade boundaries are the same as the raw mark grade boundaries as no
scaling of marks is necessary.
Uniform mark grade boundaries can be found in Appendix A of the Uniform Marks Leaflet
