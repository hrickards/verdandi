Unit grade boundaries - June 2011 exams
Diploma – Levels 1 and 2
Here you can see the scaled mark unit grade boundaries for the Diploma (Levels 1 and 2) specification Principal Learning units.
As all units consist of just one component, no scaling of marks is necessary: the scaled mark grade boundaries are the same as the raw
mark grade boundaries.
The relationship between points and grades in the Diploma can be found in Appendix B of the Uniform Marks Leaflet
For further information, contact CERP@aqa.org.uk.
